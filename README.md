---

This is the core service of Greenkeeper. It takes care of the dependency update logic and the related pull request/issue creation.

## Job Types
> ðŸš¨ðŸš§ The following documentation might be outdated. We are currently working on improving this section.

### github-event

The `github-event` job gets created by our [hooks](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/hooks) service.
It's answering all incoming webhooks from GitHub and creates this job with the full payload from github as `job.data`.
It only adds one additional `type` property to it with the name of the webhook event.

#### github-event:integration_installation

Depending on `action` a new entry is added/removed to/from the installations database.
All repositories are requested from GitHub to sync them with our database.
All repositories with a package.json receive their initial pull request (`create-initial-branch`).

#### github-event:integration_installation_repositories

Depending on `action` entries are added/removed to/from the repositories database.
Added repositories with a package.json receive their initial pull request (`create-initial-branch`).

#### github-event:push

The package.json contents are retrieved, parsed and synced to our database.

#### github-event:status

If the status affects a Greenkeeper pull_request the results are recorded in our repositories database with all metadata.

If the status of a branch is `failing`, it will create a new branch to pin to the last working version `create-pin-branch`.
When the status for that pin branch is coming, an issue is created with `create-issue`.
If that issue already exists and it's still failing it will comment `comment-issue`, but if it's
succeeding it will close that issue with `close-issue`.

#### github-event:pull_request

When an initial Greenkeeper pull request is merged the repository gets enabled (`enable-repository`).

When a Greenkeeper pull request is merged older/included pull requests for the same dependency are closed (`delete-older-branches`).
Unmergeable Greenkeeper pull requests get "rebased" (`rebase-unmergeable-branches`).

### registry-change

The `registry-change` job gets created by our [changes](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/changes) service.
It's listening for changes from npm and creates this job with the full payload from npm as `job.data`.

It figures out whether the change actually contains a new version, and on which dist-tag. It stores the versions in our npm database.

It figures out who is depending on the dependency that changed and schedules branch creation jobs for enabled ones. (`create-version-branch`)

### create-pin-branch

Creates a branch for a dependency, pinning to the version before.

### create-issue

Creates an issue with the information that a dependency is failing.

### comment-issue

Comments to an issue that a dependency is still failing.

### close-issue

Closes an issue because the dependency is no longer failing.

### create-version-branch

Used to be package-bump with our oAuth App.

If there are no tests detected, or the update is outside of the version range triggers `create-version-pr` right away.

### create-version-pr

Used to be package-send-pr with our oAuth App.

### delete-branches

Deletes all branches related to a dependency which version is less or equal to the specified one.

### create-initial-branch

Used to be package-pin with our oAuth App.

### enable-repository

Used to happen inside webservice with our oAuth App.

### delete-older-branches

Used to happen inside pull-request-close with our oAuth App.

### rebase-unmergeable-branches

Used to happen inside pull-request-close with our oAuth App.
